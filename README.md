## Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a high-quality bikes and cycling accessories organization, has approached KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team to leverage their expertise in analytics. The organization seeks help in analyzing customer datasets to optimize their marketing strategy. This project focuses on exploring the data, improving data quality, developing a customer targeting approach, and creating a dashboard to present the findings.

## Project Overview
The project encompasses three main phases: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. The objective is to identify customer trends and behaviors, determine high-value customer segments, and propose a marketing and growth strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

## Task 1: Data Quality Review
To ensure data readiness for analysis, a comprehensive data quality review was conducted. The three datasets provided by the client were assessed for completeness, accuracy, consistency, and validity. Assumptions and issues were noted, and recommendations were made to mitigate current data quality concerns.

## Task 2: Customer Targeting Approach
To recommend the most valuable customers from the new 1000 customer list, a detailed approach was devised. The approach includes activities such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting. A PowerPoint presentation was prepared to present this approach to the client for sign-off.

## Task 3: Dashboard Development
A dashboard was developed to present the data summary and analysis results to the client. The dashboard consists of one tab, designed creatively to showcase the findings effectively. The layout and presentation of the dashboard were tailored to meet the specific needs of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. The client's logo was incorporated to maintain brand consistency.
